# CVEsearchbot.py
A bot that searches CVEs, metasploit entries, and shodan. 


There's a few things you should know:

This was programmed in a few days. Some decisions may not be optimal.
This project was designed for learning the discord.py rewrite branch, 
whilst also trying to make something useful.

I've learned so much just doing this(especially about dictionaries), and I'll keep learning as long
as I'm maintaining it. 


You will need the following dependancies:

discord (pip install discord.py)

feedparser (pip install feedparser)

shodan (pip install shodan)

and pycvesearch (https://github.com/cve-search/PyCVESearch)

The rest should be a part of the core python install.

You will also need an account from https://shodan.io to use the shodan features, and
a discord bot token from https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me in order
for the script to work.

This script uses Python 3 and should be compatible with Python 3.6+
